##### Command line usage notes:
The command is optional if the command can be inferred from the source-path.  For example, if the source path is a directory containing *.eml files, they will processed accordingly.
If the source-path is a directory, the command will attempt to process the files in directory.  If the source-path is a file, it will process that file directly.
If the output file is specified, it must include the extension '.pst'.

###### Examples
Det.exe remove-duplicates --dryrun \path\to\some.pst
Det.exe dbx-to-pst --encoding shift_jis \path\to\some-dbx-files
Det.exe dbx-to-pst \path\to\some-dbx-files \path\to\some.pst
Det.exe eml-to-pst --adjust "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Storage Folders" %USERPROFILE%\Import.pst
Det.exe move-folder \path\to\some.pst source\folder\path  \path\to\some.pst destination\folder\path
Det.exe list-folders \path\to\some.pst some\folder\path
Det.exe list-top-senders \path\to\some.pst
Det.exe list-total-duplicates \path\to\some.pst

###### dbx-to-pst
The optional --encoding option allows you to add a preferred encoding, in the rare case, that encoding can not be detected properly.  It must be a string that is recognized by Encoding.GetEncoding, along with Encoding.RegisterProvider(CodePagesEncodingProvider). Valid encoding strings can be found here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.encoding?view=net-7.0
If a PST file location is not specified, it will use the base location of the DBX files.

###### eml-to-pst
Some applications, like 'Windows Live Mail' often include interim folders, such as 'Imported Folders', 'Local Folders' and 'Storage Folders', creating unnecessary levels of nested folders.  Using the --adjust option will remove these interim folders in the PST file.

###### merge-folders
Sometimes, folders get duplicated, like in the following manner:
Testing
Testing (1)
Testing (1) (1)
Testing (1) (2)

If you ever try to move or copy a folder to a place where a folder with that name exists, Outlook will add, but will give it a name an appendix like ' (1)'.  In import or export processes, often these are the exact same folders, so you can end up with multiple duplicate folders like this.  This will merge these folders into a single folder.  If there are duplicate mail items, these will copied.  So, this wil not remove the duplicate mail items.  But, it doesn't create any duplicates and the merging of folders, is an essential precursor to the eventual duplicates removal.

###### move-folder
The third and fifth parameters specify the folder path with Outlook itself, starting with the root folder name.  The root folder name will almost always be the same as the PST file name.  You can also check at the very top folder for the PST within Outlook.

###### remove-duplicates
If no PST path is provided, it will attempt to remove all duplicates in all folders in all stores of the default or current Outlook account.
Use the --dryrun option to see which messages WOULD be deleted.
Use --flush to empty the deleted items folder at the end.
For large stores, this can take some time.

#### Library and API usage:
Except for command line argument processing, all of the functionality is located in the main library project.  The main APIs match the command line commands.

The main classes are Migrate, OutlookFolder, OutlookItem and OutlookStore.
Migrate is for migrating messages in other formats into Outlook.  Some examples:
```c#
Migrate.DbxToPst(dbxPath, pstPath);
Migrate.EmlToPst(dbxPath, pstPath);
```
OutlookAccount acts on the entire default or current Outlook account.  OutlookStore acts on a specific store (PST file).  OutlookFolder acts on a specific folder.
For cleaning up Outlook, you could use the following:
```c#
OutlookAccount outlookAccont = new ();
outlookAccont.MergeFolders();
outlookAccont.RemoveDuplicates();
```
